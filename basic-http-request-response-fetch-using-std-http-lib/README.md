# Serverless Http Request, Response, and Fetch Example

Serverless boilerplate code to use incoming requests, make a fetch request, and then return an HTTP response.
This example uses standard HTTP libraries in RUST to build HTTP Request and Response.

The function makes a basic fetch request to `https://httpbin.org/get` and returns the response.
