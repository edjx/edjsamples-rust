# Serverless Http Request, Response and Fetch Example

Serverless boilerplate code to use incoming request and make a fetch request and then return a http response.
This example uses standard http libraries in RUST, to build Http Request and Response.

The function makes a basic fetch request to `https://httpbin.org/get` and return the response.
