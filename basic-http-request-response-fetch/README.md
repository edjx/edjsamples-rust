# Serverless Http Request, Response and Fetch Example

Boilerplate code to use incoming request and make a fetch request.

This example uses EDJX HttpRequest, HttpResponse, and Fetch APIs.

This function demonstrates how to use the libraries in serverless code on the
EDJX platform. The function makes a basic fetch request to `https://httpbin.org/get` and returns the response.
